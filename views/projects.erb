							<p class="list-selector">Receiving help from a robot was Cristen Torrey’s dissertation topic. When face to face, a help giver has contextual information that can be used to tailor communication. Current research on robotic helpers seeks to leverage these benefits of physically embodied interaction without acknowledging that receiving help is not always a positive experience. Help recipients may feel scrutinized, or they may feel the helper has taken control of their activity. Cristen’s dissertation research examines both positive and negative byproducts of receiving help, testing whether help from a robot is perceived as evaluative or controlling.
